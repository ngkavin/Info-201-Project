## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The dataset that we will be working with is a college majors dataset. It contains information about the majors that college students have taken and statistics about these students such as the breakdown in gender and wages. The data was collected by the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. We accessed the data through a FiveThirtyEight repository on [github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/9e9cee37d0695ccc6866c67f38373675231758ab/college-majors)
Our target audience is students who have yet to declare their major (or incoming college students) as this dataset includes information from recent graduates and their majors. Undeclared students would find this dataset useful as it shows relevant information pertaining to their desired major.
From the dataset we want our audience to learn about which college majors are most popular among students today, as well as the majors that lead to higher employment rates, and how gender affects salary rates between individuals that have graduated with the same major.
Three specific questions that our project will answer are: 
What is the male to female ratio in popular majors?
How does gender affect the salary of individuals with the same major?
What are the employment statistics for a given major? (Unemployment/wages)

## TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
The format of our final product will be a Shiny app. The data that we will be reading is in the form of a .csv file. To answer the questions above we will need to clean, reshape and reformat our data to fit the selected variables we will need to complete the project. Besides the common libraries that we have been using in class, we will also be using ggplot, lubridate, stringr, data.table, tidyr, readr and plotrix. 
Some challenges we anticipate while working on this project is encountering conflicts when trying to push changes made to the same code to github. We will need to be very diligent and communicate well to make sure that we are not trying to write over each othersâ€™ code. Another challenge we might face is cleaning and filtering the data. There is a lot to the dataset, so it could be difficult to present all of the information in a way that is easy to understand yet informative.  
What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
