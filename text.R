# Welcome!
summary <- "This is a preview of what our project is about as it contains:
<ul>Information about the <b>majors</b> that college students have taken</ul>
<ul>Statistics about these students such as a breakdown in <i>gender</i> and <i>wages</i>.</ul>

The word cloud displayed shows all the majors based on their popularity.

<br>Three questions that our project will answer are:
<ol>1) What is the male:female ratio in popular majors?</ol>
<ol>2) Does the popularity of majors correlate to wages?</ol>
<ol>3) What are the employment statistics for a given major?</ol>"

pop1 <- "This graph shows the relationship between the popularity of a major,
and the wages that graduates are earning. The plot can be adjusted to display
the earnings of those who have earned a graduate degree or an undergraduate
degree. The yearly wages can be adjusted to be the 25th, 75th, or 50th percentile
(median) of earnings for their respective major.
<br><br>
Looking at undergraduate median wages, there does not seem to be a
significant corelation with the popularity of a major, and the wages
that the degree holder earns. At the extremes, petroleum engineers
have by far the highest median wage with $126k, but the major ranks
as the 134th most popular out of the 173 majors tracked.
Business Management and Administration is by far the mst popular major
with just under 3 million undergraduate degree holders, but at a median
wage of $60k a year, it is only the 62nd highest earning major. This
by no means is low, but it does not explain the popularity of this
particular major.
<br><br>
There are only 22 majors with more than 500,000 undergraduate degree
holders, and they earn an average of $58,909.09 a year, which is only $325.57
more than the average median wage across all of the majors, $58,583.82, a
0.55% difference.
<br><br>
These results are similar among the graduate degree holders where there is
no significant correlation between the popularity of a major and the wages
earned. The most popular major, Psychology ranks 133 in wages, and the highest
earning major, Health and Medical Preparatory programs, ranks 50th in popularity.
However, graduates do earn more than undergraduates with an average
median wage of $79,363.64 compared to $58,909.09, a $20,454.55 a year difference.
(29.59% higher).

gender <- "This pie chart shows the ratio of men to women that are recent college
graduates from a particular major. The pie chart can be adjusted to show the ratio 
of men to women in any of the listed majors the user desires to view.
<br><br>
Looking at the ratio of men to women graduates from <b>engineering</b> majors it seems that
the general trend is that women only make up ~25%, while men make up ~75%. In contrast, the 
ratio of men to women in the <b>social sciences </b> and <b>arts</b> are flipped, where women make up
the majority of those graduates."

employment <- "This bar chart shows the the amount of recent graduates that are employed compared to those
that are unemployed based on the major they graduated with. The chart breaks down to those that are
employed full-time, full-time-year-round and part-time employed.
<br><br>
For the majority of majors listed, students who graduate end up with a full-time job. But these numbers do
vary due to the sample size of each major varying."
