# Welcome!
summary <- "This is a preview of what our project is about as it contains: 
<ul>Information about the <b>majors</b> that college students have taken</ul>
<ul>Statistics about these students such as a breakdown in <i>gender</i> and <i>wages</i>.</ul>

The word cloud displayed shows all the majors based on their popularity. 

Three questions that our project will answer are:
1) What is the male:female ratio in popular majors?
2) How does gender affect the salary of individuals with the same major?
3) What are the employement statistics for a given major?"
